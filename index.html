            <h1>Exploratory Data Analysis of CT Electric Vehicles</h1>
            <p><a href = "https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-registration-data" class = link>This dataset</a> contains information about electric vehicles registered in the state of Connecticut from 2021 onwards. It is important to note that the most recent data is from 12/31/2024, and that the weights of regular/non-commerical vehicles are unreported, which may lead to bias in investigating Connecticut Electric Vehicle weight or age.</p>

            <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
            <p>We peform exploratory data analysis on the following variables present in the dataset:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vehicle Make</li>
                <li>Registered Usage</li>
                <li>Type of EV</li>
                <li>Vehicle Weight Category</li>
                <li>Weight</li>
                <li>Year</li>

            <h2>Final Hypotheses</h2>
            <p>Based on this EDA, we propose the following hypotheses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The rise in EV registrations in Connecticut prior to 2024 was as a result of falling EV prices, tax benefits in buying an EV, and scientific advancement in EV efficiency.</li>
                <li>Significant falling in EV registrations in Connecticut is due to anticipating federal policy changes that have discouraged EV registration in the past year.</li>
                <li>School bus weight distribution has fewer outliers because of the standardized size and limited distributors of school buses.</li>
            </ul>
